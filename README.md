This application was inspired by a Super Bowl prop bets pool and is designed to automate the picks making and scoring necessary for such pools. 

It has two main components: a standard web application powered by Django, and a pure Javascript single-page application that makes use of Django for its API. 

Both can be seen by running the Django development server and going to http://127.0.0.1:8000 in a web browser.

The page that loads by default has links to both versions.
